# ScavengerHunt
Scavenger hunt is a game that tests your knowledge of geography using the Google Maps API.
In order to play, you need to download an API key from Google and insert it in the play.html file:

    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=[INSERT_API_KEY_HERE]&callback=initMap"
    async defer></script>

After entering the key the map should show up on the play.html page.
